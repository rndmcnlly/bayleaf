title: Whole Document Retrieval
author: Adam Smith
author_url: https://adamsmith.as
description: Agentic retrieval from OWUI Knowledge bases — list and read full documents by name rather than relying on vector/embedding search. Useful when "Bypass Embedding and Retrieval" is enabled or when the model needs to reason about which documents to consult before reading them. All operations are gated by the calling user's KB access grants.
