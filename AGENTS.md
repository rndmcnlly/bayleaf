Guidelines for agentic coding agents working in this repository.

## Project Overview

Public repo for the **BayLeaf AI Playground** — an experimental Generative AI service
for the UC Santa Cruz campus community, operated by Adam Smith (Dept. of Computational
Media). **Publicly visible; never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials.**

- **BayLeaf Chat** — `https://chat.bayleaf.dev` — Open WebUI with curated models,
  invite-code-gated groups, web search/browsing tools, and rate limiting.
- **BayLeaf API** — `https://api.bayleaf.dev` — OpenRouter-proxying API with keyless
  on-campus access and key-based off-campus access, plus web search/fetch and sandboxed
  code execution. Source: `api/` in this repo.
- **BayLeaf Courses** — `https://courses.bayleaf.dev` — self-service course AI models
  for instructors. **Currently a teaser page only** (single Hono Worker serving a
  placeholder); the full service is being redesigned, see GitHub issue #4. The
  `courses/` directory still contains prototype scaffolding (D1 migrations, DAL,
  routes, templates) that is not wired up.

All LLM inference uses **zero-data-retention (ZDR)** providers via OpenRouter.

`docs/` is published via GitHub Pages at `https://bayleaf.dev`.

`api/` is a Cloudflare Worker deployed at `https://api.bayleaf.dev`.
**Read `api/AGENTS.md` before working on API code or infrastructure.**

`chat/` is an Open WebUI instance on DigitalOcean App Platform at
`https://chat.bayleaf.dev`. **Read `chat/AGENTS.md` before working on Chat
configuration, models, tools, functions, or user/group management.**

## Build / Lint / Test

The about site (`docs/`) has no build step or test suite — it is a single static HTML
file. For the API (`api/`), see `api/AGENTS.md` for build and deploy commands.

**Local preview:** Use the VS Code **Live Server** extension (right-click
`docs/index.html` → *Open with Live Server*), which serves on `http://localhost:5500`
by default. Alternatively:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory docs
```

---

## Security & Privacy

- **No secrets in the repo.** No API keys, tokens, passwords, or `.env` files.
- Any code calling LLM APIs must use ZDR providers via OpenRouter; note this in comments.
- Invite codes, filter names, and internal operational details must not appear in
  committed files.

## Agent Conduct

This repo backs a live service used by the entire UC Santa Cruz campus community.
**Do not perform destructive or publishing actions unless explicitly asked.** This
includes — but is not limited to — committing, pushing, force-pushing, deleting
branches, or modifying GitHub settings. Always show the user a diff or summary and
wait for approval before touching git history or remote state.

---

## Git Workflow

**Deploy first, commit later.** All services in this repo can be deployed to
production without committing. Use this to let the developer feel out changes in
prod before recording them in git. For `docs/` (GitHub Pages), deployment is
coupled to pushes — so use a local dev server (`python3 -m http.server 8000
--directory docs`) to preview changes before committing.

**Do not commit or push unless explicitly asked.** Deploying to a live service
is non-destructive and reversible; pushing to `main` is immediate and public.
These are different levels of commitment.

**Clean commit story over chronological accuracy.** When a session produces
multiple small, related changes (e.g. a feature + copy tweaks + style fixes),
prefer squashing them into a single coherent commit rather than recording each
micro-step. The git log should read like an intentional changelog, not a
transcript of the development session.

## Commit Style

```
add:    new content or feature
update: change to existing content or feature
fix:    bug fix
docs:   documentation only
chore:  tooling, deps, CI
```

Concise, imperative mood: `add screenshot gallery to about page` ✓
